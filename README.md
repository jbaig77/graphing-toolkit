# graphing-toolkit
This is a toolkit I'm working on under a professor at UMass Lowell as part of a scholarship. The purpose of this project is to create a toolkit specializing in solving differential equations. As of right now, the program is very basic and only graphs the contour plot of some function F(x,y).
